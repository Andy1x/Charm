A nasty potion that withers living things.

Decay cannot be brewed. If the **Witches Drop Decay** feature is enabled, decay potions may be collected this way.

All mobs affected by this potion will be given the Wither status effect.

## Ender Sight
![Ender Sight](https://i.postimg.cc/tCvXRL9M/endersight.jpg)
Brew an Eye of Ender with a Night Vision potion to make a **Potion of Ender Sight**.  When you are under the effect of Ender Sight, Endermen may be attracted to your location, and you can 'hear' a stronghold when you face the correct direction.

### Locating strongholds
The Ender Sight effect plays a sound when you face toward a distant stronghold when in the overworld. A different sound plays when you are very close to the structure itself.

In the default configuration the screen colours will be inverted - as if looking through the eyes of an Enderman.

## Flavored Cake

The following extended potions are supported:
* Speed
* Strength
