# Charm

A Vanilla+ Minecraft mod inspired by Quark.  For Minecraft **1.14.4**, recommended Forge version **28.0.45**.

This mod is incomplete and needs your help to playtest it!  You can see the [progress of the port here](https://trello.com/b/gHRK61AF/works-like-a-charm).
Please report any bugs in the github issues tracker with issue titles beginning `[1.14.4]`. With your issue, include:
1. Steps to reproduce the problem
2. A stacktrace / crash report
3. (Optional) screenshots

New feature requests will not be accepted on the issue tracker.  We are currently working on converting as much
of the 1.12.2 version of Charm as possible.

We will **never**<sup>1</sup> port Quark features into Charm.  Vazkii is working on a port, be patient and support him.
