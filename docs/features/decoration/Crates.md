# Crates

Crates offer a smaller storage solution than a chest or barrel with the benefit of being transportable making it an early game alternative to shulkerboxes.  Crates are also available in all vanilla wood variants.

The contents can be measured using a comparator, like a vanilla chest.
            
### Sealed crates

You may seal a crate with an iron ingot on an anvil - the only way to release items from a sealed crate is to break it open.  A sealed crate does not let you access its inventory and is not transportable even with silk touch.
