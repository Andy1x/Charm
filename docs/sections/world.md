Adds more ores and items to vanilla mineshafts.

* Corridors have more coal and iron ores as well as some gold.
* Lanterns and hanging lanterns appear.
* You can also find TNT and loot crates.

### More village biomes
![More village biomes](https://github.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/blob/master/web/charm-features/village-biomes.png?raw=true)
Villages now have a chance to appear in the following biomes:
* Jungles
* Bamboo Jungles
* Snowy Taiga
* Ice Spikes
* Swamps

Villagers spawning in these extra biomes will use their correct biome texture, including the unused textures for Jungle and Swamp villagers.

### Snow Storms
![Snow Storms](https://github.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/blob/master/web/charm-features/snowstorms.png?raw=true)
During a thunderstorm in a snowy biome, snow layers will increase over time.

Locations that snow is normally not able to be placed, such as next to a light source, will support snow layers being added for the duration of the storm.

Exposure to a snow storm without wearing leather armor will quickly cause the player to start freezing.
