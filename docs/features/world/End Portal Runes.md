# End Portal Runes

If the **Quark** mod is available and **Colored Runes** are enabled, you can use them in an End Portal.  Set the same runes in two portals to connect them to each other, allowing for immediate travel between Strongholds.

Sneak right-click while holding a rune to remove a rune from its frame.  To change a rune in its frame, simply right-click it with another colored rune.

Eyes of Ender present in the End Portal will be removed when right-clicking with a rune (configurable).

An End Portal will link with the **closest matching** End Portal.  Also, it's important to note that portals link when **each side** of the portal contains the same runes, regardless of the order.
