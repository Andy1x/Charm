# Moonstones

Moonstones help you locate a specific block co-ordinate across dimensions or aid in aligning builds.

Right-click while sneaking to bind the moonstone to a location.  When you are aligned to the block, the Moonstone will glow and you will hear the "homing" sound.  If you stand on the original block location, a chime will be heard.

You can right-click any block with the moonstone to find out how far away you are from the original location.

Moonstones respect the spatial compression / expansion of the Nether, helping you to align portals precisely between the Overworld and Nether.
