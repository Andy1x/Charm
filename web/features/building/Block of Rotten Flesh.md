# Block of Rotten Flesh

Craft 9 rotten flesh into a Block of Rotten Flesh for storage.  When placed in the world, the block will turn to dirt when next to water.  Placing a block under farmland will increase the speed at which planted crops grow.

Rotten Flesh blocks are also compostable by default.
