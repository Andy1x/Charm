# Decrease repair cost

Combine an item with its golden version on an anvil to reduce the original item's repair cost.

**Example**: a diamond pickaxe has a repair cost of 7 requiring 7 levels of XP to add a diamond to increase its durability. Combine a golden pickaxe on the anvil to reduce its repair cost to 5. Combine another golden pickaxe to reduce it to 3.

No more "Too expensive"!
