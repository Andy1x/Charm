## Cactuses give water
![Cactuses give water](https://i.postimg.cc/cHfHrTF8/cactuswater.jpg)
Right click a cactus with an empty glass bottle for a chance to fill the bottle with water. There is also a chance the cactus might break. 

## Cauldrons permanent water source
![Cauldrons permanent water source](https://i.postimg.cc/1XH3KXhm/cauldronwatersource.jpg)
Cauldrons act as a permanent water source for buckets and bottles when the player is sneaking. 

## Compass Binding
![Compass Binding](https://i.postimg.cc/mrHZ58f6/compassbinding.jpg)
Right-click on an active beacon while sneaking with a compass to bind the compass to the beacon location.

If the beacon has been named on an anvil, the compass will use the beacon's name. 

If the **Quark** mod is available and **Dyed Item Names** feature enabled, the compass tooltip will take the beacon beam color.  The tooltip will also show the XYZ co-ordinate of its bound location.

Hit a bound compass on the anvil with an iron ingot to turn it back into a normal compass.

## Dispensers use any bow
![Dispensers use any bow](https://i.postimg.cc/ZK5bSTzN/dispensersuseanybow.jpg)

## Extra records
![Extra records](https://i.postimg.cc/RhszFHxH/extrarecords.jpg)
All in-game background music by C418 is available on records. These records are dropped by zombies that were killed by skeletons.

## Furnaces recycle more
![Furnaces recycle more](https://i.postimg.cc/BQb0zM2c/furnacesrecyclemore.jpg)
Increase the amount of nuggets returned when smelting iron and gold items with respect to their recipe and durability.

By default, each ingot is worth three nuggets.  The default configuration allows you to recycle other items that contain iron and gold in their recipes, such as iron doors, buckets and cauldrons.

**Example**: a fully repaired iron sword has two iron ingots in its recipe.  Smelting it in a furnace yields six iron nuggets.  A damaged iron sword with 50% durability yields three iron nuggets.

## Gold Tool improvements
![Gold Tool improvements](https://i.postimg.cc/pdbMpv4q/goldtoolimprovements.jpg)
Gold tools receive a durability and efficiency buff to bring them in line with their rarity.

* Durability increase from 32 to 512
* Efficiency increase from 12.0 to 17.0

All gold tool base modifiers are configurable.

## Leather armor invisibility
![Leather armor invisibility](https://i.postimg.cc/mDjvXHD5/leatherarmorinvisibility.jpg)
Leather armor is invisible and does not increase mob awareness when drinking a Potion of Invisibility, giving you a bit more protection while you ninja. 

## Pickaxes break pistons
![Pickaxes break pistons](https://i.postimg.cc/vHcJhDd0/pickaxesbreakpistons.jpg)
Pickaxes are now the effective tool for breaking pistons and sticky pistons, rather than no effective tool.

## Random animal textures
![Random animal textures](https://i.postimg.cc/g0qQjZv2/randomanimaltextures.jpg)
Wolves and cats may spawn with different textures. Wolves may be brown, grey or black.  Cat textures are related to the cat type and use the textures from Minecraft 1.14.

## Records stop background music
![Records stop background music](https://i.postimg.cc/CKV9wNn2/recordsstopbackgroundmusic.jpg)
When a record is played in a jukebox, the in-game background music will be stopped and prevented from playing. 

## Remove nitwits
![Remove nitwits](https://i.postimg.cc/h43wXg7T/removenitwits.jpg)
Prevents nitwits from spawning as new villagers.  This doesn't remove existing nitwits from the game and only affects baby and cured villagers.

## Restrict furnace input
![Restrict furnace input](https://i.postimg.cc/3RxSwb8t/restrictfurnaceinput.jpg)
Vanilla furnaces allow any item in its input slot, regardless of whether it can be smelted.  This feature limits the input slot to allow only items that have a smelting recipe.

This allows you to use the furnace as a sorter, or recycle loot from mobfarms into nuggets without unstackable items blocking all your furnaces over time.

## Sheared melons
![Sheared melons](https://i.postimg.cc/dtbx9B60/shearedmelons.jpg)

## Stackable milk buckets
![Stackable milk buckets](https://i.postimg.cc/KcVqZNd5/stackablemilkbuckets.jpg)
Milk buckets can stack up to 16, making it a bit less cumbersome to negate effects. 

## Stackable potions
![Stackable potions](https://i.postimg.cc/ncDdMmxf/stackablepotions.jpg)
Potions, water bottles, potion bases (mundane, awkward etc) and their splash/lingering varieties can stack up to 16 making them sortable and more convenient to carry around.

## Tamed animals take no damage
![Tamed animals take no damage](https://i.postimg.cc/1tdH3mYz/tamedanimalsnodamage.jpg)
Tamed animals no longer take direct damage from players. They still suffer secondary effects, such as burning from a Fire Aspect sword. 

## Use Totem of Undying from inventory
![Use Totem of Undying from inventory](https://i.postimg.cc/7Y0pddfz/usetotemfrominventory.jpg)

The **Quark** mod must be installed and the **Spectre** feature enabled for this to work.
