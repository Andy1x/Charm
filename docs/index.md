# Charm

Charm is a **Forge Mod** for **Minecraft 1.14.4 and 1.15.2**, inspired by [Quark](https://quark.vazkii.us/), that adds to the vanilla experience of Minecraft without drastically changing its gameplay.  Charm does not require **Quark** to be installed but is designed to play nicely with it and extend some of its features.

It's a *modular* mod in that you can turn on or off any of the mod features via the config file.

Charm is a **Forge Mod** for **Minecraft 1.14.4**.  You need to install the **Java Edition**
of Minecraft and then the [correct version of Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) for the version of Minecraft you want to play.  Once you have done this, drop the **Charm jar file** in your **mods** folder and start the game.

After the game starts for the first time, you can edit the **charm-common.toml** file (in the config folder) to change things about Charm.  Each of Charm's features can be disabled or tweaked to fit your playstyle.
