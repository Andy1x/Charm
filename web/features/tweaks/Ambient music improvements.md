# Ambient music improvements

"Creative" music may now play in survival mode. When a music disc is played in a jukebox, in-game ambient music will be stopped and prevented from playing so that you don't get two tracks playing at the same time.

In addition, the delay between ambient music tracks has been shortened and cold biomes have a chance of playing the "Charm" ambient music.
