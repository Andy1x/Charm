![More village biomes](https://i.postimg.cc/4Nmz5n89/More-village-biomes.png)
Villages now have a chance to appear in the following biomes:

* Bamboo Jungles
* Snowy Taiga
* Ice Spikes

Villagers spawning in these extra biomes will use their correct biome texture, including the unused textures for Jungle and Swamp villagers.
