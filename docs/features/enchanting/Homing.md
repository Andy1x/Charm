# Homing

Combine the **Homing** enchanted book with a pickaxe, shovel or hoe on an anvil to enable the tool to help you locate ore. The tool will be attracted to ore of the same ingots/gems that make up the head of the tool.

By right-clicking on a block, you will hear a sound that rises in pitch as you get closer to the ore. Doing so will decrease the durability of the tool.

This enchanted book is not available via the enchantment table and can only be found as a treasure enchantment.
