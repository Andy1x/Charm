## Decrease repair cost
Combine an item with its golden version on an anvil to reduce the original item's repair cost.

**Example**: a diamond pickaxe has a repair cost of 7 requiring 7 levels of XP to add a diamond to increase its durability. Combine a golden pickaxe on the anvil to reduce its repair cost to 5. Combine another golden pickaxe to reduce it to 3.

No more "Too expensive"!

## Extract Enchantments
![Extract Enchantments](https://i.postimg.cc/mgKVM7Bk/Extract-enchantments.png)
Extract enchantments from any enchanted item into an empty book on an anvil. Enchantments at level 1 will be preserved, but enchantments higher than level 1 will be weakened by one level. The enchanted item will be destroyed in the process.

## Pig Iron increases durability
Pig iron nuggets can be combined on an anvil with a tool, weapon or armor to give a small durability boost regardless of the material the item is made from.  Repairing tools with pig iron does not add to their repair cost.

The **Nether Pig Iron** module must be enabled for this to work.
