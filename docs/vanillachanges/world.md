![More village biomes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/master/web/charm-features/nope.png)
Villages now have a chance to appear in the following biomes:
* Jungles
* Bamboo Jungles
* Snowy Taiga
* Ice Spikes
* Swamps

Villagers spawning in these extra biomes will use their correct biome texture, including the unused textures for Jungle and Swamp villagers.
