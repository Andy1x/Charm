## Curse Break
Combine the **Curse Break** enchanted book with any cursed item on an anvil to remove the curse.

This enchanted book is not available via the enchantment table but can be found as a treasure enchantment or be obtained by trading with a librarian villager.

## Extra Curses
Adds more potenial item enchantment curses to ruin your day.

These extra curses may occur naturally on treasure items or get added to an item if the **Spectre** feature is enabled and a player gets into close contact with at least one of them.

Beyond the default Minecraft curses, this feature adds the following:

* **Curse of Rusting**: item durability degrades much faster than normal when the item is used.
* **Curse of Clumsiness**: there is a chance that the item will not perform when used, for example, a sword swing will do no damage or a pickaxe will not drop a block after mining it.
* **Curse of Haunting**: when an item is used, there is a chance that a hostile mob will spawn nearby. The default configuration allows Zombies, Skeletons, Witches, Endermen and Spectres to spawn.
* **Curse of Harming**: when an item is used, there is a chance that the player will receive a small amount of direct damage.

Curses may be removed by using the **Curse Break** enchanted book, if enabled.

## Homing
Combine the **Homing** enchanted book with a hoe on an anvil to enable the hoe to help you locate ore. The hoe will be attracted to ore of the same ingots/gems that make up the head of the hoe.

By right-clicking on a block, you will hear a sound that rises in pitch as you get closer to the ore. Doing so will decrease the durability of the hoe.

This enchanted book is not available via the enchantment table and can only be found as a treasure enchantment.  Currently, only hoes made of iron, gold or diamond may be enchanted with the Homing enchantment.

## Magnetic
A tool with the **Magnetic** enchantment adds block drops straight to your inventory.  This enchantment may also be added to shears.

## Salvage
An item with the **Salvage** enchantment does not disappear when its durability is depleted, giving you a chance to get it repaired.

If the item runs out of durability the player will drop it and it must be picked up again. Watch out for lava.
