# Bookshelf Chests

This is a bookshelf that has 9 inventory slots for storing books.  It provides the same enchanting power as a normal bookshelf as long as there is at least 1 slot occupied, and can be crafted from each of the 6 vanilla wood types.

The texture will change as books are added or removed.

The **Bookshelf Chest** does not currently make use of **Quark**'s drop-off and sort functionality.

Contents can be measured using a comparator, outputting a signal based on the number of filled slots rather than the quantity of items.
