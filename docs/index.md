# Charm
Charm is a **Fabric Mod**<sup>1</sup> for **Minecraft 1.16.3**, inspired by [Quark](https://quark.vazkii.us/), that adds to the vanilla experience of Minecraft without drastically changing its gameplay.
Charm does not require **Quark** to be installed but is designed to play nicely with it and extend some of its features.

It's a *modular* mod in that you can turn on or off any of the mod features via the config file.

## For older versions of Minecraft
Charm for Minecraft 1.12 and Minecraft 1.15 are no longer being actively maintained.  `1.12` is occasionally supported with serious bug fixes.
You can read the [1.12 documentation here]({{site.baseurl}}/features-1.12/index) and the [1.15 documentation here]({{site.baseurl}}/features-1.15/index).

## Installation
To play Charm, you must:
* install the **Java Edition** of Minecraft.  We recommend [MultiMC]() to more easily install and run Minecraft with mods
* install the most up-to-date [version of Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/)
* download the latest version of [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and drop the jar file in your **mods** folder
* download the latest version of [Charm](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/charm) and drop the jar file in your **mods** folder 

After the game starts for the first time, you can edit the **charm.json** file (in the config folder) to change Charm's configuration.
Each of Charm's features can be disabled or tweaked to fit your playstyle.
