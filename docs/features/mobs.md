## Chickens drop feathers
![Chickens drop feathers](https://i.postimg.cc/NMDVKF01/Chickens_drop_feathers.png)
Sometimes chickens drop a feather instead of laying an egg.  After dropping a feather, the amount of time until another egg or feather drop is reduced by half.

*Vegan friendly!*

Tamed animals no longer take direct damage from players. They still suffer secondary effects, such as potion effects from a tipped arrow.

If you are in Creative Mode, this feature is bypassed.
