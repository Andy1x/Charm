# Flavored Cake

Right-click on a cake with a redstone extended potion to imbue it. Each slice of the cake will give you the potion effect when eaten. You may also use [a dispenser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPcuKgwFMps) to apply the potion to the cake.

The following extended potions are supported:
* Speed
* Strength
* Jump Boost
* Regeneration
* Fire resistance
* Water breathing
* Invisibility
* Night vision

**Quark**'s potions will be supported in a future release of Charm.
