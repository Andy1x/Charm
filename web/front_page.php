    <h2>Welcome to Charm!</h2>
    <p>
        Charm is a <strong>Forge Mod</strong> for <strong>Minecraft 1.14.4</strong>, inspired by <a href="https://quark.vazkii.us/">Quark</a>, that adds to the vanilla
        experience of Minecraft without drastically changing its gameplay.  Charm does not require <strong>Quark</strong> to be installed but is
        designed to play nicely with it and extend some of its features.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's a <em>modular</em> mod in that you can turn on or off any of the mod features via the config file.

    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <p>
        Charm is a <strong>Forge Mod</strong> for <strong>Minecraft 1.14.4</strong>.  You need to install the <strong>Java Edition</strong>
        of Minecraft and then the <a href="https://files.minecraftforge.net/">latest version of Forge</a>.  Once you have done this, drop the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/charm/files/2827085">Charm file</a> in
        your <strong>mods</strong> folder and start the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the game starts for the first time, you can edit the <strong>charm-common.toml</strong> file (in the config folder) to change things about Charm.
        Each of Charm's features can be disabled or tweaked to fit your playstyle.
