# Tallow increases durability

Tallow can be combined on an anvil with a tool, weapon or armor to give a small durability boost regardless of the material the item is made from.  **Quark** must be present and Tallow enabled for this to work.

Each time tallow is used to repair, there is a chance the item's future repair cost will be increased.  Since tallow only has a small durability boost, a complete repair of the item from low durability is not recommended, as it may become too expensive to add enchantments or combine with another item.
